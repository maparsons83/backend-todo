This is an app to serve up and manipulate a locally hosted dictionary.  All CRUD functionality can be used through POSTMAN.  Please clone repo and install dependencies.  Once environment is active, the app can be run with "python app.py".

"flask run" will not work.  App must be run via "python app.py" on the command line.
